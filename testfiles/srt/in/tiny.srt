1
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,094
A beginning is
a very delicate time.

2
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,766
Know then, that
it is the year 10191.

3
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,394
The Known Universe is

4
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,605
ruled by the
Padisha Emperor Shaddam IV,

5
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,983
my father.

6
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,571
In this time, the most precious
substance in the Universe

7
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,656
is the spice melange.

8
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,993
The spice extends life.

9
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:21,873
The spice expands
consciousness.

10
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,461
The spice is vital
to space travel.

11
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,672
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,

12
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,968
who the spice has
mutated over 4,000 years,

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,763
use the orange spice gas,

14
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,349
which gives them
the ability to fold space.

15
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,643
That is,

16
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,190
travel to any part of
the Universe without moving.

17
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,319
Oh, yes.
I forgot to tell you.

18
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,155
The spice exists

19
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,700
on only one planet
in the entire Universe.

20
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,371
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

21
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,292
Hidden away within the rocks
of these deserts

22
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,878
are a people
known as the Fremen,

23
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,632
who have long held a prophecy,

24
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,550
that a man would come,

25
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:19,555
a messiah, who would
lead them to true freedom.

26
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,393
The planet is Arrakis.

27
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,314
Also known as Dune.

28
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,070
A secret report
within the Guild.

29
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,074
Four planets have
come to our attention

30
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,745
regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.

31
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,874
Planet Arrakis,
source of the Spice.

32
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,045
Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.

33
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,674
Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.

34
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:21,177
Planet Kaitain,

35
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,305
home of the Emperor of
the Known Universe.

36
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,268
Send a third-stage
Guild Navigator to Kaitain

37
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,271
to demand details
from the Emperor.

38
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,191
The spice must flow.

39
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,863
Father?

40
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,865
Irulan, you must leave.

41
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,099
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

42
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,643
We felt his presence.

43
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,229
I shall want telepathy
during his visit

44
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,314
and a report
when we're finished.

45
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,192
I am your Truthsayer, my lord.

46
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,778
He's here, my lord.

47
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,851
The Bene
Gesserit witch must leave.

48
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,479
Leave us.

49
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,815
Yes, my lord.

50
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,995
We are alone.

51
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,210
We have just
folded space from Ix.

52
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,711
Yes?

53
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,173
How was your journey?

54
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,592
Many machines on Ix.

55
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,720
New machines.

56
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,139
Oh?

57
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,974
Yes.

58
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,018
Better than those on Richese.

59
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,481
You are transparent.

60
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,776
I see many things.

61
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,239
I see plans within plans.

62
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,909
I see two great houses,

63
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,998
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen feuding.

64
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,835
I see you behind it.

65
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,170
Yes.

66
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,423
You must share with us.

67
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,594
The Atreides House is
building a secret army

68
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,512
using a technique
unknown to us.

69
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,973
A technique involving sound.

70
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,351
The Duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

71
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,395
He could threaten me.

72
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,105
I have ordered House Atreides

73
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,524
to occupy Arrakis
to mine the spice,

74
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:48,777
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

75
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,362
House Atreides will not refuse

76
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,407
because of the tremendous power
they think they will gain.

77
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,159
Then, at an appointed time,

78
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,287
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis

79
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,040
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

80
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,708
I have promised the baron

81
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,961
five legions of
my Sardaukar terror troops.

82
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,633
So the Harkonnens will
rid you of House Atreides.

83
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,301
Yes.

84
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,929
One small point.

85
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,765
Here it comes.

86
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,268
We, ourselves,
foresee a slight problem

87
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,938
within House Atreides.

88
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,150
Paul. Paul Atreides.

89
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,238
You mean, of course, Duke
Leto Atreides, his father?

90
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,991
I mean Paul Atreides.

91
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,036
We want him killed.

92
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,249
I did not say this.

93
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,210
I am not here.

94
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,003
I understand.

95
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:22,204
Why would they
want the Duke's son killed?

96
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,545
We must have
a look at Paul Atreides.

97
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,714
On Caladan.

98
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,315
The powerful
Bene Gesserit sisterhood,

99
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,816
for 90 generations,

100
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
has been manipulating
bloodlines

101
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,112
to produce
the Kwisatz Haderach.

102
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,780
A super being.

103
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,491
On Caladan, Jessica,

104
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,993
a member of the sisterhood

105
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,330
and the bound concubine of
Duke Leto Atreides

106
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,374
had been ordered to
bear only daughters.

107
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,626
Because of her love
for the Duke,

108
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,213
she disobeyed
and gave birth to a son.

109
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,259
Paul. Paul Atreides.

110
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,146
Here we are now. Caladan.

111
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,149
And 1 9 light-years beyond.

112
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,860
Beyond Bene TIeilax.

113
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,029
The training
planet of the Mentats,

114
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,655
the human computers.
